Last year the Scottish government held a consultation on licensing air weapons, but a majority of responders opposed the plan. One-year-old Teenie was found injured by her owner Sarah-Nisbett in NiddryView, Winchburgh, at about 16:30 on Friday-14-March and taken to the Scottish-SPCA. Mrs-Nisbett said the cat was now having to learn how to walk again. \"The gun that was used must have some power because the pellet actually went through her back leg, that's why it was so badly damaged,\" she said. \"She's now learning how to hop around the house, it's terrible. \"The fact that it was three shots is crazy. We live in a housing estate and there are lots of kids. That just makes it worse because any of them could have been hit in the crossfire.\" She added: \"There's some sick people out there, hopefully somebody will know who's done this and let the police or the Scottish-SPCA know.\" Scottish-SPCA Ch-Supt-Mike-Flynn said: \"Teenie's owners are understandably very upset and keen for us to find the callous person responsible to ensure no more cats come to harm. \"This is an alarming incident which only highlights why the Scottish government should implement the licensing of airguns as a matter of urgency.\" He added: \"The new licensing regime should ensure that only those with a lawful reason are allowed to possess such a dangerous weapon. It will also help the police trace anyone using an air gun irresponsibly.\" Last year the Scottish government launched a consultation on licensing air weapons, with a large majority of those who responded opposing the plan.Under the proposed scheme, anyone wanting to own an air gun would need to demonstrate they had a legitimate reason for doing so. A total of 87% of respondents rejected the idea with some describing it as \"draconian\" and \"heavy-handed\".  A small number of people felt ministers were not going far enough. The Scottish-SPCA urged anyone with information about the incident to contact them.",

  "article": "The incident began on Tuesday morning when border agents encountered two men carrying backpacks five-miles(8km) east of Sumas, Washington, in the US. Authorities say agents interrupted an attempt to smuggle a load of MDMA, or ecstasy, from Canada to San-Francisco. Two others were arrested and accused of planning to transport the drugs. On Tuesday morning, US border agents ordered the two men they encountered near the border to halt, officials said. One of the men dropped his backpack, fired a weapon at the agents, and ran, according to a criminal complaint filed in US federal court in Washington on Wednesday. The officers took the other man, identified as Jeffrey-Laviolette, into custody immediately. Canadian and US police searched for the fugitive on foot and by helicopter, putting up road blocks. Nathan-Hall, a Canadian citizen, was arrested by the Abbotsford-Police-Department in British-Columbia early on Wednesday morning. According to border patrol agents, the backpacks Mr-Hall and Mr-Laviolette were carrying contained a total of 58lb(26kg) of ecstasy. Also inside one backpack was a California driver's licence with the name of William-Nickerson but a picture of Nathan-Hall, the complaint alleges. Investigators later arrested a Bellingham, Washington woman, Kali-Henifin, who they say planned to pick the two men up at the border. They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan-Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $11,000 to drive the drugs to San-Francisco. Ms-Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint. The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges.The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western-District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are \"a large part of our practice\".",

Jamie-Mitchell, 35, of Apple-Close, had admitted intervening in an argument between Mr-Dickie and his mother. He shouted \"yes\" and was visibly shaking after the verdict was announced by a jury at Winchester-Crown-Court. The trial heard Mrs-Mitchell and Mr-Dickie had been in a relationship for several years and were going through a \"down phase\" when Mr-Mitchell visited his mother at the park on 7 May. In the evening, Mr-Mitchell accompanied his mother and Mr-Dickie to the holiday park bar and got \"tanked up\" on alcohol. The two men had a confrontation outside and were separated by members of the public. Mr-Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight. He and his mother Samantha, 57, also of Apple-Close, also admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying about the course of events. The court heard the pair had initially told police that Mr-Dickie had pushed Mrs-Mitchell and she had pushed him back. But Mr-Mitchell later told police that he had tried to push the couple apart, causing what he described as a \"tragic accident\". The pair will be sentenced on 6 February.",

The company's manager later admitted selling stolen Indian antiquities, including the bronze being returned. The allegations first came to light during a 2012 court case against the firm for trafficking antiquities. The sculpture of Hindu goddess Uma-Parameshvari is thought to have been stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil-Nadu in southern India. The decision to return the item came after discussions between Singapore's National-Heritage-Board and the Indian government body looking after its antiquities, the Archaeological-Survey-of-India (ASI). The ASI submitted an official request for the return of the sculpture in May, according to the museum. \"While there is no conclusive proof that the sculpture was stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil-Nadu, India, ACM took note of the confession of Aaron-Freedman, who was the manager of Art of the Past, of dealing in looted Indian antiquities and of criminal possession of 150 stolen objects,\" the museum said in a statement. It was one of 30 objects ACM bought from the art dealer, although none of the others are thought to be listed as stolen. The ASI was reportedly allowed to view them, anyway.The museum said it will take legal action to get compensation for the apparent fraud.",

  "article": "An Uber driver who was credited with stopping a potential mass shooting in Chicago at the weekend by pulling out his own personal firearm and shooting the would-be gunman will not face any charges for his actions, a court has decided. Prosecutors say the driver with a concealed carry permit shot a 22-year-old man who opened fire on a group of pedestrians in Logan-Square. Court records say the man, identified by The Washington-Post as Everardo-Custodio, shot at people walking in front of the driver's vehicle on Friday night in the busy neighborhood. The driver - a 47-year-old man from the Little-Italy neighborhood - then grabbed his own weapon and fired six rounds at Custodio, striking him multiple times. The bullets hit him in the legs and lower back, according to reports. The man was taken to a local hospital for treatment. The incident occurred about 11.50pm and there were no other injuries. Police have not yet released a motive for Everado's shooting. However Assistant State's Attorney Barry-Quinn says the driver, who has a firearm owner's identification card, acted in self-defense and the defense of others. The driver is not facing charges Everado was ordered held without bail Sunday. He's facing charges of aggravated battery with a firearm and illegal possession of a firearm.",

  "article": "The humble honeybee may only be small, but scientists are hoping to use its brain to power a series of futuristic-style drones. Boffins are currently working towards digitally recreating the cognitive abilities of the Apis-Mellifera or European Honeybee. Their final aim is to build a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like the tiny insects. Scientists are working towards building a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like a honeybee. Professor James-Marshall said if they were able to recreate a fraction of the honeybees ability they would have made 'tremendous advances'. The artificial brain is being created by the Green-Brain-Project, which is a collaboration between researchers from the Universities of Sheffield and Sussex. One day it is hoped the remote controlled machines could be used to pollinate crops or even assist on search and rescue missions. 'Bees and all other insects are miracles of engineering which we are nowhere near equalling,' Professor James-Marshall reportedly told the BBC. 'If we could even recreate a fraction of their abilities in a robot system then we would have made a tremendous advance.' Building an artificial brain is a complex process and so far, scientist have only managed to clone the part of the bee's brain which allows it to see. To do this they mapped out the  brain of the honeybee and recreated it with circuits that fire on and off in an organic brain, Discovery-Magazine reported. The software is then uploaded into the drone's circuitry which enables it to  fly around in a similar fashion to the bee. The projects team now has three quadcopters and one ground robot, each with unique abilities and configurations. Tests are being carried out in a dedicated flying room based at the University of Sheffield. In a video footage showing initial tests the drone, powered by the artificial bee brain, can be seen flying down a corridor. On the Green-Brain website it states: 'Since the start of the project, the GB team has setup the lab, built and tested our robots, and begun to demonstrate some sophisticated visual-based navigation and cognitive functions through embodiment. 'Current projects include navigation using the GB models, flight tests of our models with the BeeBot quadcopter, developing a Ground-Control-Station, initial testing with the chemosensors and more.'

  "article": "Two Transportation-Security-Administration (TSA) screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at Denver-International-Airport, Denver police said.  Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris-Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February-9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles-Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim. The TSA said it has been trying to identify the passenger in the February incident but to no avail. The TSA said no passengers have come forward with similar cases so far at the Denver airport.",

And there are no two baseball teams that are greater, or more storied, than eternal rivals the New-York-Yankees and Boston-Red-Sox, who come in first and second respectively in terms of the number of people who claim them as their favorite. Also making a very impressive showing are the Texas-Rangers and Atlanta-Braves, who have fans across a wide area in the South. Then there are a few teams who don't get as much love - like the New York Mets.

The Mets are not the favorite team in one county in the country, with fans in their area seeming to all go for the Yankees. Same goes for the Oakland Athletics. The Toronto-Blue-Jays can also claim almost all of Canada, though the Yankees and Red-Sox are also favorites in some areas. The graph, created by Facebook, uses profile likes and then breaks the individuals down by country to determine a winner.

  "article": "An argument between two Brisbane neighbours over noise levels has ended in tragedy with one man dead and another charged with manslaughter. Leon-Yeaman, 55, was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip-Pama, 28, during a row in front of their north Brisbane homes. Mr-Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller-Road making a lot of noise at around 9pm Thursday night. Phillip-Pama covered his face as he left Brisbane-Magistrate Courts where he was granted conditional bail on Friday. Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr-Yeaman was making a commotion. Pama's defence lawyer Bruce-Peters said Mr-Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music and yelling at 'the world at large'. Pama then confronted Mr-Yeaman and it was at that point the situation escalated. Mr-Peters said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out 'blindly'. 'He was being pushed at the same time he was throwing the punch,' Mr-Peters revealed during a bail application for Pama. 'He didn't see it connect but he felt it connect.' The father of three allegedly killed his 55-year-old neighbour with one punch after he refused to turn his music down. Paramedics were unable to revive Mr-Yeaman who was pronounced dead at the scene at around 11pm on Thursday night. Neighbours described Mr-Yeaman as king and generous while his friend John-Fisher told ABC Radio he was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music. Pama shielded his face from reporters outside Brisbane-Magistrate Courts when he was granted bail on Friday. The Samoan man was ordered to surrender his passport, aherre to a curfew from 6pm to 2am and will have to report to the local police station twice a week. Pama, who has no history of violence, was reportedly 'beside himself' with grief. The case is due to return to court on May 18.",

The performer, who was also an accomplished guitarist, was first diagnosed with cancer in 1990, the year he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the year before he released the album that ignited his career. The cancer returned in 2005 and then again in 2014, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. He died Friday in a hospital in Istanbul, five days after his 66th birthday. \"We are in grief over losing Kayahan, who contributed to Turkish music with countless compositions and marked a generation with his songs,\" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu tweeted. The singer, whose full name was Kayahan Acar, was born in Izmir province, in western Turkey on March 29, 1949. He grew up in Ankara, Turkey's capital, before moving to Istanbul. In 1990, he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, finishing 17th. The following year he released an album titled \"I Made a Vow,\" which catapulted him to prominence. Though he recorded nearly 20 albums, that one would remain his most popular. His final album was released in 2007. Other artists recorded his material throughout his career. Videos available online show a vibrant performer with a thick shock of dark hair as he accompanies himself on guitar and croons in a clear tenor. Kayahan was best known for his love songs. More recent videos show a  frailer performer, seated and without a guitar, but still clearly glorying in the joy of singing a song.",

He added: \"If I were to release on bail there are substantial grounds to believe she would be a risk to herself and a risk of failing to attend for whatever reason.\" I will therefore have to remand in custody. It will have to be a male prison in Winchester but it will be an issue for the prison service.\" He also told the jury at Portsmouth Crown Court: \"It's been a slightly unusual case and it's not been an easy case.\" The court heard that Ayrton, who has learning difficulties, attempted to commit suicide last summer. Protocols have been put in place for her detention at the prison, a court officer explained.During the trial Ayrton spoke about her sexuality, and said she she had not \"made any physical changes or enhancements\" to her body or taken any medication. She changed her name in 2012. Portsmouth Crown Court was told she raped the teenager while two others were asleep in the garage. The victim said she shouted and swore at Ayrton to stop the attack, but her friends had not woken up. She had \"only drunk a can and a half of Foster's\" and clearly recollected the events. The court heard that in 2014 Ayrton told a worker at the care home where she lived in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, about the attack.",
